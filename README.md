Utilizing the StarWars API, SWAPI-box is a single page application that allows its users to explore the rich world of StarWars, as well as bookmark their favorite characters, planets, and vehicles.   
This project utilizes ReactJS, Router, and has been fully tested with Enzyme/Jest.  

SWAPI Box is project designed to challenge our skills at manipulating data and creating small, reusable React components, as well as obtaining complete testing coverage through unit and assurance tests.  

## Goals for this project

* Get comfortable fetching APIs, testing, and cleaning data.
* Use a modular architecture for your application file structure.
* Keep state based components to a minimum and leverage more functional components.
* Use propTypes to validate props passed to each component.
* Write meaningful, comprehensive unit and integration tests.
* Implement React Router.
